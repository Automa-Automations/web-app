Automa Automations is software designed to automate content creation using AI. While this is the web application, my brother and I are working on the <a href="https://github.com/Automa-Automations/automa-mobile-app" target="_blank">iOS application</a>. If you are a designer, a Kotlin developer, or any other type of developer and are looking to collaborate, feel free to check out [how to become a team member](https://github.com/Automa-Automations/.github/blob/main/profile/join_our_team.md). 

## Technologies
Here are the technologies used for the web application:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Flask

## Project Motive
My <a href="https://github.com/AdonisCodes" target="_blank">brother</a> and I have a strong desire to automate tasks, especially content creation. This stems from a few years back when we mass-uploaded YouTube Shorts on multiple YouTube channels and sold those channels. The problem was that we were manually uploading all the shorts, which was extremely repetitive and boring. This led us to create some automation scripts, eventually leading to this project.

What is our primary objective for Automa Automations? Automa Automations aims to help content creators upload content more consistently, allowing them to spend less time and money to achieve more.

## Future Vision
Currently, our goal is to launch an MVP in the next 1-2 months. By then, we aim to at least automate uploading AI-generated images to an Instagram account, fully automated. Users will be able to create an Instagram account and attach the "AI Image Uploader Bot" to that account. There will be some configuration options as well. While this may not sound impressive, it is just the start, as we plan on working on Automa Automations for years to come.

Our future vision is to support all major social media platforms. Not only that, we aim to support automatically creating content in various forms, from shorts, long videos, blog posts, and much more.
